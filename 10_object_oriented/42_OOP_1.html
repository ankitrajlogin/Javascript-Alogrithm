    <h3>Does Javscript have classes</h3>
    <div>Yes, JavaScript has classes. They were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and provide a simpler and clearer syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance. Classes in JavaScript are syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance.</div>
    <div>Syntactic sugar is a term used in programming to describe syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or to express. It makes the code more human-readable and often more concise without adding new functionality to the language. Essentially, it's a way to make the code "sweeter" for human use.
        For example, in JavaScript, classes are syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance system. They provide a more intuitive and familiar way of creating objects and handling inheritance, similar to what is found in other object-oriented programming languages like Java or C#.</div>
    <div>Prototype-based inheritance is a style of object-oriented programming in JavaScript where objects inherit directly from other objects. This is different from class-based inheritance, where objects are instances of classes, and classes form a blueprint for creating objects.
        In prototype-based inheritance, each object has a property called prototype, which is a reference to another object. When you try to access a property or method on an object, the JavaScript engine first looks at the object itself. If it doesn't find the property or method there, it then looks at the object's prototype, and so on, up the prototype chain until it finds the property/method or reaches the end of the chain.</div>

    
    <h3>Ojbects and classes</h3>
    <div>In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs where the keys are strings (or symbols) and the values can be of any data type, including other objects, functions, or primitives. Objects are used to represent real-world entities or abstract data structures.</div>
    <div>Classes in JavaScript, introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), provide a more structured and syntactic way to create objects and deal with inheritance. A class is a blueprint for creating objects with specific properties and methods.</div>

    <h3>What is Object Literal</h3>
    <div>An object literal is a straightforward way to create a single object in JavaScript. This method is useful for creating simple objects without the need for a blueprint (class or constructor function).</div>

    <h3>Prototypes</h3>
    <div>Prototypes
        Prototypes allow you to add properties and methods to constructor functions after they are defined. Every function in JavaScript has a prototype property, which is used to build the prototype chain.</div>

    <h3>Classes</h3>
    <div>
        Classes in JavaScript provide a more structured and syntactic way to create objects and handle inheritance. They are syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance.</div>

    <h3>Instance ('new' , 'this') </h3>
    <div>Instances (new, this)
        Instances are created using the new keyword, which calls the constructor function or class constructor. The this keyword within the constructor refers to the newly created instance.</div>

    <h3>Abstraction</h3>
    Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it, providing a simplified model.
    In this example, Vehicle abstracts the concept of starting an engine without revealing the internal details of how the engine actually starts.

    <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
    Encapsulation bundles the data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposes a controlled interface for interacting with the object.
    In this example, name and age are encapsulated within the Person class using private variables _name and _age, and access is controlled through getter methods (getName and getAge).


    <h3>Inheritance</h3>   
    Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass). It promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes.
        In this example, Dog inherits from Animal using the extends keyword. It overrides the speak method to provide specific behavior for dogs, while still inheriting the name property and speak method from Animal.


    <h3>Polymorphism</h3> 
       Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even if they share the same name.
    In this example, Dog and Cat are subclasses of Animal. Despite sharing the speak method name with Animal, they each provide their own implementation (barks for Dog and meows for Cat), demonstrating polymorphism.
